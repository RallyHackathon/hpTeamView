hpTeamView
=========================

## Overview
This is an app written for HP to help them visualize dependencies between stories and teams.  On the left, there is a project tree.  When clicked, a dropdown showing Iterations and Releases is shown.  Choosing a timebox will then show the Stories and Defects in the chosen timebox and team in two grids on the left. On the right, another grid will appear showing stories dependent on the stories and defects in the left grid.  These dependencies are tracked by HP using a custom field called SWPWorkflowDependencies.
